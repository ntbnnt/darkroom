# Costs

This film runs around $30 for 24 exposures before shipping from the Film Photography Project. It is supposedly repackaged arial photography film that was used for vegetation surveys. Here's a gallery of work by [Dean Bennici](http://www.bennici.net/fotografie/). Here's straight from the [horse's mouth](http://www.tarquinius.de/).

# Scanning

The film does not have any film base which is problematic for scanning it turns out. I scanned in film as color negatives on a Cannoscan 9000F and the resulting TIF files had great detail but the film's colors became blue and saturated. Overall, a very cool but unnatural effect. I liked the effect on abstract subjects but not so much on objects that individuals recognized.

Scanning in the film flat on the scanner had good results but required a lot of work in Photoshop to get the film frames isolated as well as positioned correctly. I don't currently recommend this route I liked having the film backlit in the scanner for better detail anyway.

So far scanning in the film as a color positive retains the most qualities you would expect with infrared film - namely the reds as the scanner is scanning the frame and not doing much else. The sky shot above looks entirely more like it came from a roll of infrared film as a color positive.

Of paritcular note is that using a yellow filter when shooting with this film caused the clouds to turn black.

# Processing

Film says to process E-6 but it can be cross-processed C-41. The Film Photography Project says this ruins the infrared film but I don't think that is the case. My C-41 infrared film came out fine and survived.

## C-41

This is considered to be the "cross processed" method of handling aerochrome but professionals who work with the film note that the C-41 process makes for a better final product. I rather liked the reds I got out of the C-41 processed film that I have done so far and other who have worked with aerochrome note that the film processed as E-6 has oversaturated reds.

## E-6

TBD, chemicals are on the way :D

# Shooting

My first roll of infrared film was shot on an Nikon N80 with a 40mm macro DX lens that vignetted just a bit. The Nikon N80 has an infrared sensor that notably and understandably fogs the sprocket holes in the film. The Film Photography Project notes that using the film with a camera like the N80 that has an infrared film positioning sensor is impossible but that does not appear to be the case at all. Post-processed film does not appear fogged up into the frame, at least with the N80.

Future rolls are probably going to be shot in strictly manual cameras simply due to the cost of the film and because I want to see if I note any differences.

## ISO

I shot my film at ISO 400 as per the recommendations. Need to look into changing that as I've read that a 1/3 stop reduction in sensitivity for each 1,000 feet of altitude is needed.

## Sensitive Light

The film is not true IR because it is sensitive to some visible and near IR light. This leads to false colors and a filter must be used.

The more blue light you remove, the more red there will be.

You can shoot it with no direct sunlight - overcast too.

## Bracketing

It is expensive to do so but bracketing is really the way to go because sunlight, altitude and cover affect the film in a wide variety of ways. 

## Focusing

I'm getting some really strange effects for high depth of field shots - namely ghosting of images. The plane of focus appears to be slightly different than shooting with normal film. I focused through the viewfinder and did not treat the film any differently and everything turned out as I wanted it too with the exeception of some "ghosting". Note the mountain ridge in the scanned positive image above.

## Filters

I used a yellow filter for most of my shooting. It certainly brings out the red more in highlights. In shots without a filter, highlights appear to be undersaturated.

The film is very sensitive to blue light and using a yellow or orange filter seems to be the norm.

### IR

You can use an IR sensor to block all visible light and avoid any false colors created at all. Probably a huge waste of time.

### Yellow

* Causes clouds to turn completely black.

* Brings out red in highlights more, at least in cross-processed aerochrome.

* The blue sky gets notably "soft" and the darker the sky, the more pink-white gradient that is established. In shots with a graduated neutral density filter, I noted a very nice even gradient that went from white to pink to a deep red. Made for a nice sky.

### Orange

# Post Processing

## Color Balance

Pretty much a requirement to color balance this film. Scanning the film in flat offers more control over this process since the scanner tries to do color balancing for you.

### Printing

I had to make slight adjustments to the cyan filter on the color enlarger to get prints that weren't green. In the future, I'll likely just make digital negatives for contact printing as that will allow me to cast the color overlay that the paper expects.

## Everything else

Adjust and see what happens. Some of the properties of this film lends itself to having unexpected results from mundane adjustments that are quite artistic, cool, and expressive.
